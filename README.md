# MyReads Project

This was made for book lovers! MyReads allows you to track your books, sort books by shelf (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Read) and search new books to add them to your shelf. This project was part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program to train working with React and refactoring static code into an interactive single page application.
